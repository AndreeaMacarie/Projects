This repository contains all the projects that I make while learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.

HTML and CSS projects starts by opening the youtube.html file or by typing live-server in Visual Studio Code(VSC) console and selecting youtube.html.

JavaScript projects can be started by typing live-server in VSC console.

React projects can be started by installing Node, installing npm(npm i in VSC console) and starting npm(npm start)
